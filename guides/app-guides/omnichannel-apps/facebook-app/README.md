# Facebook App

Omnichannel Integration between Rocket.Chat and Facebook Messenger. With the Facebook Messenger app, you can handle messages from your Facebook contacts directly in Rocket.Chat. It works simply: your FB customers contact you via Messenger, you answer chats from Rocket.Chat. Some key features of this integration include sending messages with quick reply buttons, welcome messages\(starting/closing chat\), file sharing, and the correlation between your FB pages and your Rocket.Chat departments.
